# Dependency Injection
## Library

This library provides a basic (but powerful) way of doing dependency injection using a `Resolver` class and an `@Inject` annotation.

The way of using it is pretty much the same as done with the Swinject project.

You can check out the [Demo App](https://github.com/alejandroivan/DependencyInjection-Demo) to see how it works.
